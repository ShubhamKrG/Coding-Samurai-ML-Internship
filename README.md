TASK_1: Iris Species Detection

Objective: To create a ML model to predict the species of flowers based on their features.

The contents used for the completion of the task are:
          
          1. jupyter notebook -  Prediction of Flower Species.ipynb
          2. Data - Iris.csv  
          3. Python file - Iris Species Prediction app.py
          4. SVC_model.pkl
          5. Scaler.pkl
          6. Encoder.pkl
                                  
The last three are pickle files used in the python file while creating the web application.
