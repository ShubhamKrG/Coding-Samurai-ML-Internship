TASK_1: Iris Species Detection

Objective: To create a ML model to predict the species of flowers based on their features.

The jupyter notebook "Prediction of Flower Species" contains following models :

                                        1. Logistic Regression 
                                        2. Decision Trees
                                        3. Random Forest
                                        4. SVM Classifier

The hyperparameter tuning has also been implemented seperately for each model.

For the web application, "Iris Species Prediction app" python file has been created via Spyder IDE and Streamlit library 
for which following three pickle files have been used:
                          
                                   1. SVC_model.pkl
                                   2. Scaler.pkl
                                   3. Encoder.pkl
